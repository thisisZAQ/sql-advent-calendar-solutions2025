-- Table Schema:
-- Table: npn_users
--   user_id: INT
--   user_name: VARCHAR
--
-- Table: npn_messages
--   message_id: INT
--   sender_id: INT
--   sent_at: TIMESTAMP
--

-- My Solution:

WITH daily_counts AS (
    SELECT
        DATE(m.sent_at) AS message_day,
        u.user_id,
        u.user_name,
        COUNT(*) AS message_count
    FROM npn_messages m
    JOIN npn_users u
        ON m.sender_id = u.user_id
    GROUP BY
        DATE(m.sent_at),
        u.user_id,
        u.user_name
),
ranked_users AS (
    SELECT
        message_day,
        user_id,
        user_name,
        message_count,
        RANK() OVER (
            PARTITION BY message_day
            ORDER BY message_count DESC
        ) AS activity_rank
    FROM daily_counts
)
SELECT
    message_day,
    user_id,
    user_name,
    message_count
FROM ranked_users
WHERE activity_rank = 1
ORDER BY message_day, user_name;
