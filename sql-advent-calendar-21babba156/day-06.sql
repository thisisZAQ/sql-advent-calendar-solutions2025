-- Table Schema:
-- Table: resort_monthly_snowfall
--   resort_id: INT
--   resort_name: VARCHAR
--   snow_month: INT
--   snowfall_inches: DECIMAL
--

-- My Solution:

SELECT
    resort_id,
    resort_name,
    annual_snowfall,
    NTILE(4) OVER (ORDER BY annual_snowfall DESC) AS snowfall_quartile
FROM (
    SELECT
        resort_id,
        resort_name,
        SUM(snowfall_inches) AS annual_snowfall
    FROM resort_monthly_snowfall
    GROUP BY resort_id, resort_name
) yearly_totals;
