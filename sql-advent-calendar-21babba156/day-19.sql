-- Table Schema:
-- Table: holiday_orders
--   order_id: INT
--   customer_name: VARCHAR
--   gift_wrap: BOOLEAN
--   paper_used_meters: DECIMAL
--   delivery_status: VARCHAR
--   order_date: DATE
--

-- My Solution:

SELECT SUM(paper_used_meters) AS total_paper_used_meters
FROM holiday_orders
WHERE gift_wrap = 1
  AND delivery_status = 'Delivered';
