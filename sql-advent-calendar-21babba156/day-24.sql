-- Table Schema:
-- Table: user_goals
--   user_id: INT
--   user_type: VARCHAR
--   goal_id: INT
--   goal_status: VARCHAR
--

-- My Solution:

WITH user_completed_goals AS (
    SELECT
        user_id,
        user_type,
        COUNT(*) AS completed_goals
    FROM user_goals
    WHERE goal_status = 'completed'
    GROUP BY user_id, user_type
)
SELECT
    user_type,
    AVG(completed_goals) AS avg_completed_goals
FROM user_completed_goals
GROUP BY user_type
ORDER BY user_type;
